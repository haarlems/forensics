# Forensic investigation methodology
[Digital forensics](https://www.nist.gov/digital-evidence) is the field of forensic science concerned with ***retrieving, storing and analyzing*** data that can be useful in investigations. <br />
This includes information from computers, mobile phones, IoT devices, motor vehicles, drones, or the cloud. <br />
**Digital forensic investigators** face challenges such as:
- extracting data from damaged devices;
- locating evidence among vast quantities of data;
- ensuring that their methods capture data **reliably**, without altering it in any way.

The term **DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response)** is often used referring to the broader discipline including incident response.

## Objectives of the [digital forensic process](https://www.unodc.org/cld/en/education/tertiary/cybercrime/module-4/key-issues/standards-and-best-practices-for-digital-forensics.html)
- identification;
- collection;
- analysis;
- reporting;
- preservation.

## Evidence
Main _**types of evidence**_ retrieved and analyzed:
- disk (files, logs, command history, browser artifacts, etc.);
- memory (process, linked libraries, network connections, etc.);
- network capture.

## Chain of custody
Preserving the *integrity* of the evidence (preventing alteration or deletion) is prioritized. <br />
**Chain of custody** is used to track evidence by documenting each person and organization who handles it, the date/time it was collected or transferred, and the purpose of the transfer. <br />
