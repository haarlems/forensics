# Intro to Digital Forensics
[Digital forensics](https://www.nist.gov/digital-evidence) is the field of forensic science concerned with ***retrieving, storing and analyzing*** data that can be useful in investigations. This includes information from computers, mobile phones, motor vehicles, IoT devices, drones or the cloud. <br />
**Digital forensic investigators** face challenges such as:
- extracting data from damaged devices;
- locating evidence among vast quantities of data;
- ensuring that their methods capture data **reliably**, without altering it in any way.

The term **DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response)** is often used referring to the broader discipline including incident response.

## Standards for digital evidence handling
According to ISO/IEC 27037:
- identification;
- collection;
- acquisition;
- preservation.

## Evidence
Main _**types of evidence**_ retrieved and analyzed:
- disk (files, logs, command history, etc.);
- memory (process, linked libraries, network connections, etc.);
- network capture.

For each skill learned in the lab, you will use a subsection which will touch up on new concepts.
